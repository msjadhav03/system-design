# URL Shortening Service 
        Key Concepts: Scalability, load balancing, database schema design.
        Considerations: Generating unique short URLs, redirecting to original URLs, handling high traffic, analytics, and data retention.

# Social Media Feed 
        Key Concepts: Data modeling, real-time updates, feed ranking algorithms.
        Considerations: User posts, comments, likes, following/followers, privacy settings, and content filtering.

# Distributed Cache
        Key Concepts: Caching strategies, consistency, sharding, eviction policies.
        Considerations: Data partitioning, cache synchronization, cache expiration, and cache consistency.

# Chat Application
        Key Concepts: Real-time communication, message storage, presence, message encryption.
        Considerations: Group chats, media sharing, end-to-end encryption, and message synchronization.

# Content Delivery Network 
        Key Concepts: Caching, edge servers, request routing, load balancing.
        Considerations: Global distribution, content replication, cache eviction, and efficient content retrieval.

# Distributed File System 
        Key Concepts: Data replication, fault tolerance, sharding, data consistency.
        Considerations: Block storage, metadata management, data rebalancing, and data recovery.

# Online Marketplace
        Key Concepts: User accounts, listings, search, bidding, transaction processing.
        Considerations: User profiles, seller ratings, payment processing, and fraud detection.

# Authentication and Authorization System
        Key Concepts: Authentication methods (OAuth, JWT), user roles, access control lists.
        Considerations: Single sign-on (SSO), two-factor authentication (2FA), and security best practices.

# Recommendation System 
        Key Concepts: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, personalization.
        Considerations: User behavior tracking, data processing, recommendation algorithms, and A/B testing.

# Traffic Analytics System
        Key Concepts: Data collection, real-time processing, analytics pipelines.
        Considerations: Data ingestion, data warehousing, query processing, and data visualization.

During system design interviews, focus on the following principles

    Scalability: Ensure your system can handle increased load and traffic.
    Reliability: Design for fault tolerance and high availability.
    Efficiency: Optimize resource usage and minimize latency.
    Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data.
    Maintainability: Create systems that are easy to maintain and extend.
